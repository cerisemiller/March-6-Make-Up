# March-6-Make-Up
makeup assignment for March 6 class


In the class on March 6, 2018, Rich finished up the Week 4 lesson on jQuery.
He opened class by taking a poll to figure out which topic areas students 
are having trouble with and which ones have been "mastered". Since jQuery methods
came in as the topic most students were having issues with, Rich went through an
ad-hoc activity to go over some popular methods and how to use them.
