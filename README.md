# March-6-Make-Up
makeup assignment for March 6 class


In the class on March 6, 2018, Rich finished up the Week 4 lesson on jQuery.
He opened class by taking a poll to figure out which topic areas students 
are having trouble with and which ones have been "mastered". Since jQuery methods
came in as the topic most students were having issues with, Rich went through an
ad-hoc activity to go over some popular methods and how to use them.

The "This Example" activity was more challenging than expected. Although I was 
able to get the first few examples correct, the bonus ones were very difficult 
to understand. Although the concept of this is challenging, I also think it has
to do with my confusion around the structure of functions. This is definitely
something I need to spend more time working on.

The jQuery Calculator activity left me feeling completely stranded. I ended up 
waiting until Rich went over the code line by line at the end of the session
since I did not have a team or classmates to work with. I definitely thing jQuery 
is my weakest area and needs the most of my attention.
